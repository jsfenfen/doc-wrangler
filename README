"""
Routines to wrangle document cloud projects into a local DocumentCollection and vice versa. Assumes a db model has been built with documents/models.py and manage.py sycndb--and that there is a properly tagged 'project' of documents on document cloud that's been shared with the owner of the documentcloud credentials. 


$python manage.py shell

>>> from documents import docwrangler
>>> docwrangler.create_local_project(1234)

Reporters often leave out the related article URL, but this URL is the same for all the documents across the project. So alter it in the django admin: /admin/documents/documentcollection/1/

Then push the url back to dc documents:

>>> docwrangler.push_project_url('your-local-DocumentCollection-slug')

And publish the whole thing:

>>> docwrangler.publish_now('your-DocumentCollection-slug')

Or unpublish it 

>>> docwrangler.unpublish('your-DocumentCollection-slug')
